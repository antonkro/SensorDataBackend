##Motivation and Goal of this Project
The Reutlingen University will build a new lab in room 020 in building 20. 
This new lab will be called "Ambiented Assisted Living". The lab will have 
different sensors, for example UV sensors, temperature sensors, lock sensors 
etc., to measure the data. The measured data will be stored in a database 
and will be analyzed at a later time. The goal of this project is to create 
a backend system based on REST web services.  We will use the REST web 
services to push the measured data onto a database and then analyze that 
data by filtering and visualizing the data.
